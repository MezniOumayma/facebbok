## HOW IT WORKS? ‚ö°
This is some next-level social engineering shizzle. It's a recreation of Facebook's login page, but with a sneaky twist. The backend is coded in PHP, which is like the stealth bomber of Backend Programming Language. When someone logs in, their info gets yoinked right into the admin panel, which is like a secret lair hidden behind a fake login box.

But that's not even the coolest part. This tool is so badass, it also has a bash script that can stream real-time data of the filled-in info. It's like a continuous drip feed of juicy user data. This prank is so epic, I'm surprised my friends even fell for it. I mean, they're not exactly tech noobs. But then again, I'm like a ninja with code, so what can you expect?

This tool is a testament to the power of social engineering and the flexibility of programming languages. It's a reminder that even the most familiar technologies can be twisted into something unexpected. So next time you're feeling mischievous, remember this tool and unleash your inner hacker!
